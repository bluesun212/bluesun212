## Introduction
Hello everyone, my name is Jared Jonas.  I'm a PhD student attending UC Santa Barbara in the mechanical engineering department.  I work with Dr. Bassam Bamieh researching computational methods in dynamics and controls.  Specifically, I am interested in methods in model reduction, system identification, and controller design, but have coauthored a paper relating to optimal transport theory and distributed parameter system control. 

Outside of research, I am an avid programmer, having spent the better part of my life doing so.  I have several interesting repositories on GitHub, but currently am working on a suite of projects whose goal is to convert LaTeX documents to HTML webpages, suitable for statically served websites or presentations.  I expect this project to be done sometime this summer, so if that sounds interesting, consider following me!

## Research 
Here is a list of papers I have (co)authored:
1. [J. Jonas, B. Bamieh, "An Adaptation of the AAA-Interpolation Algorithm for Model Reduction of MIMO Systems"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644885), published in the 2024 IEEE American Control Conference
2. [M. Emerick, J. Jonas, B. Bamieh, "Causal Tracking of Distributions in Wasserstein Space: A Model Predictive Control Scheme"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10886628), published in the 2024 IEEE Conference on Decision and Control
3. [J. Jonas, B. Bamieh, "An iterative tangential interpolation framework for model reduction of MIMO systems"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03410), submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control
4. [J. Jonas, B. Bamieh, "An Interpolation-based Scheme for Rapid Frequency-Domain System Identification"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00525), submitted to the 2026 IEEE American Control Conference
